# Introduction

Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a buzzword; it's a fundamental shift in how we approach software engineering. From code generation to predictive UX, AI is becoming an embedded part of the development lifecycle.

## The Rise of Agentic Coding

Gone are the days of simple autocomplete. Agents like **Antigravity** (wink) are enabling developers to:

1. Architect complex systems
2. Refactor legacy codebases
3. Generate comprehensive test suites

## Integration in Next.js

Using tools like Vercel's AI SDK, we can now stream responses directly from LLMs to our React components.

```tsx
import { useChat } from 'ai/react';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat();
  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map(m => (
        <div key={m.id}>
          {m.content}
        </div>
      ))}
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input value={input} onChange={handleInputChange} />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## improved DX

Developer experience has never been better. We can focus on high-level problem solving while AI handles the boilerplate.

### Conclusion

Embracing AI is not about replacing developers, but empowering them to build faster, better, and more ambitious software.
