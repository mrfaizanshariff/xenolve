# Introduction

While everyone chases billion-dollar unicorns, smart indie hackers are building micro-SaaS businesses: small, focused products that solve specific problems for niche audiences. These businesses might not make headlines, but they're making founders wealthy.

## What Makes Micro-SaaS Special

Micro-SaaS businesses have unique advantages:

1. **Low overhead**: One person can build and maintain the entire product
2. **Focused scope**: Deep expertise in one narrow area
3. **Loyal customers**: Solving specific pain points creates sticky users
4. **Quick validation**: Ship MVPs in weeks, not years

## Finding Your Niche

The best micro-SaaS ideas come from personal experience. Look for:

### Industry-Specific Tools
Accountants, lawyers, dentists—every profession has unique software needs often poorly served by generic tools.

### Workflow Enhancements
Products that sit on top of existing platforms (Shopify apps, Chrome extensions, Notion templates) tap into established user bases.

### Integration Glue
Connecting two popular services that don't talk to each other is a classic micro-SaaS opportunity.

```javascript
// Example: Simple micro-SaaS architecture
const microSaasStack = {
  app: {
    frontend: "Next.js",
    backend: "API routes",
    database: "PostgreSQL (Supabase)",
    auth: "NextAuth.js"
  },
  monthly_costs: {
    hosting: "$20",
    database: "$25",
    email: "$10",
    tools: "$15",
    total: "$70"
  },
  break_even: "7-10 customers at $10/mo"
};
```

## The Path to $10K MRR

The micro-SaaS journey typically follows this pattern:

- **Month 1-2**: Build and launch MVP
- **Month 3-6**: First 10 paying customers ($500-1000 MRR)
- **Month 6-12**: Reach 100 customers ($3K-5K MRR)
- **Month 12-24**: Optimize and scale to $10K+ MRR

### Real Success Stories

- **Bannerbear**: Image generation API - $80K MRR
- **Plausible**: Privacy-focused analytics - $100K MRR
- **Fathom**: Simple analytics - $140K MRR
- **TweetHunter**: Twitter growth tool - $150K+ MRR

All started as solo or two-person teams solving specific problems.

## The Beauty of "Boring" Businesses

The most successful micro-SaaS products aren't sexy or innovative. They're:

- Solving real pain points
- Doing one thing exceptionally well
- Charging fair prices to happy customers
- Operating sustainably without external funding

## Conclusion

You don't need to build the next Facebook. A focused product serving 500 customers at $20/month creates a $10K MRR business that can change your life. The micro-SaaS gold rush is happening now—start digging.
